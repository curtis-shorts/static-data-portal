**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è** You only need to interact with **this** repository if you are improving the `generator` or using this code to start a self-managed project. If you want to deploy a data portal, copy our [example-data-portal](https://github.com/globus/example-data-portal) and modify the `static.json` file to suit your needs.
